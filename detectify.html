          <h2>  Detectify crowdsource platform
          </h2>
          <p> Detectify crowdsource platform is a redesign.
          </p>
          <h3> My role
          </h3>
          <p> Through a design case, my role was to develop new features and
            redesign the interface based on two given personas.
          </p>
          <h3> Challenge
          </h3>
          <p> The Crowdsource platform is a security research platform where
            ethical hackers provide Detectify with valuable security research.
            By reporting the vulnerability to Detectify, the ethical hackers
            helps secure hundreds of websites through automation. Today, Detectify
            Crowdsource is a network of over 150 ethical hackers from all over
            the world with different sets of skills and experiences. The challenged
            concerned the issue of how to improving the first-time experience and
            to make onboarding more engaging for many different types of users.
          </p>
          <h3> Approach
          </h3>
          <p> To develop the platform I have applied a Human-centered design
            perspective, working through the phases of empathise, define, ideation,
            prototype and test. During the phase of empathise I gathered insight
            on user needs through given personas, by reading blog posts written
            by ethical hackers on Detectifies website and by developing user
            journeys. During the define-phase I framed the challenge by adding
            context and stating ultimate impact that the platform could have.
            Through the phase of ideation i created ideas and design solutions
            through brainstorming methods. Through the phase of prototyping I
            developed an engaging first-time experience using Sketch and Invision.
            Last but not least, I analyzed and tested the design by letting
            friends using it. It’s a about iterating!
          </p>
          <h3> Solution
          </h3>
          <p> Through a UX perspective I developed a walkthrough in order to
            give an insight into what crowdsource is about and to teach users
            about uncommon features. I also developed a blank slate for guidance
            in the form of an example of how the application will look, feel and
            behave when in full use. Through a UI perspective the layout and
            structure is based on cards in order to display content composed of
            different elements. i developed a lighter color theme, consistent
            with the website for recognition. I developed consistent buttons and
            icons to enhance and illustrate actions.
