          <h2> Book a meeting room
          </h2>
          <p> Book a meeting room is a progressive web app that was developed
            during a course between january and may 2019 together with The
            Swedish School of Library and Information Science at Borås University.
          </p>
          <h3> My role
          </h3>
          <p> I was part of a team where we together were responsible for the
            experience strategy and design of the prototype. I lead the UX work
            and developed a Hi-fi prototype in Sketch.
          </p>
          <h3> Challenge
          </h3>
          <p> The library is an essential place where students can meet up and
            study together. However, the amount of space is limited, and working
            places and meeting rooms are well sought after. Today's digital
            booking system is limited, covering the need to book a room, but
            isn't flexible and doesn't enable the user to find a room based on
            current needs or individual preferences. The challenged concerned
            the issue of how to create a modern library by making meeting rooms
            effective, dynamic, and flexible to use.
          </p>
          <h3> Approache
          </h3>
          <p> To come up with and to develop the idea of an improved booking system
            we have applied a Human-centered design perspective, working through
            the phases of inspiration and ideation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Initial, during our Inspiration phase we watched  and listened to
            our target group through interviews and observations in order to
            better understand the users and to get smart on our challenge.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the Ideation phase, we started to make sense of everything we
            had observed  and went into generate ideas through methods such as
            team idea mapping.  To identify opportunities for design and to test
            and refine our solution we created personas to guide design decisions,
            priorities and create empathy amongst our focus group. From our
            personas, we created user requirements which makes up the cornerstones
            of our app.
            <br>
            <br>
            The prototype was developed through an iterative process, going from
            a low-fi prototype to being developed as a hi-fi prototype. The
            low-fi prototype concerned the structure of the app, like hierarchy,
            navigation and user flows. The hi-fi prototype concerned user
            interface and feel, including layout, font, color, pictures etc.
          </p>
          <h3> Solution
          </h3>
          <p> Through the app, users can book, find, share, confirm, and cancel
            meeting rooms in an easy and accessible way. When booking a meeting
            room the user can choose a room based on several features like size,
            equipment and location. The app makes the booking system more
            effective and dynamic by adding features which makes it easier to
            confirm, cancel and share meetings and meeting rooms. If a meeting
            gets canceled there is a function which lets other students know
            when room gets available with short notice. By adding social
            features the user can send an invitation to others who will attend
            the meeting. The user can also add the meeting directly to its
            calendar, which make it compatible to other apps on the device.
