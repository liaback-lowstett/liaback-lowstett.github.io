          <h2> MACRO
          </h2>
          <p> MACRO is a non-profit organization that works with young people to
            create a sustainable and healthy environment. They arrange activities
            through movie productions, sports gathering and music events. One of
            these activities are the movie production Project Boomerang.
          </p>
          <h3> My role
          </h3>
          <p> My role in MACRO is an ongoing collaborate and includes several
            projects within visual identity and web design. My first task was
            to develop a style guide for MACRO and Project Boomerang.
            Based on the style guide, I’ve developed a poster for a casting event
            for Project Boomerang.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, I’m developing their upcoming website. For the website I
            have created flow charts, storyboards and wireframes. The next phase
            is to develop the site with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <h3> Challenge
          </h3>
          <p> When I meet the project group they wanted to create a cohesive
            design language that could be used on multiple platforms and in
            different contexts. The challenge where to create a visual identity
            applicable and recognised through different situations and design
            elements, such as digital media, print and motion picture.
          </p>
          <h3> Approache
          </h3>
          <p> When developing the style guide I began by evaluating the current state of
            design and what MACRO wanted to mediate through their projects.
            This led to workshopping with the team to figure out what was working
            and what was not. From the workshop the design language begun to
            take form.
            <br>
            <br>
            When developing the website I’ve applied a Human-centered design
            perspective, working with methods such as personas, user
            requirements and prototypes. The website is being
            developed according to conventional user interface design
            guidelines. It should be accessible to all users, responsive on
            different devices and  easy to navigate. The interface should have
            cohesive graphic profile, in accordance with the style guide.
          </p>
          <h3> Solution
          </h3>
          <p> The style guide is now being implemented on various
            platforms used by MACRO and Project Boomerang. It includes a dark
            theme with bright elements and an orange accent color. The visual
            identity was designed to feel bold with a hint of attitude but still
            generic enough to serve as a neutral look in several contexts.
