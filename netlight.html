          <h1> EdgeEx Vol. 5
          </h1>
          <p> EdgeEx Vol. 5 is a festive event with inspiring talks for employes
            at Netlighters, clients, students and partners with a total of 300
            people. The theme was all about the magic of a circus and the event
            took place in a circus tent.
          </p>
          <h3> My role
          </h3>
          <p> My role was to create a poster with the event moto and information
            about where the event would take place and at what time and date. Except
            from that, I was asked to set free all my creativity.
          </p>
          <h3> Approache
          </h3>
          <p> I started to research previous events and its design and how
            Netlight usually are branding themselves. I took inspiration from
            the circus realm and everything it includes, from horses to popcorn
            and all the people that creates the show or that comes and visit it.
            After the inspirational research I experimented with colors and font
            until a got the look I was aiming for. Last but not least i started
            to put everything together in indesign and illustrator.
          </p>
          <h3> Solution
          </h3>
          <p> The poster consist of a background inspired by the pattern of a
            circus tent that draws the attention towards the information in the
            middle of the poster. The information text is framed by a playful
            and nostalgic  frame which together with the font enhance the circus
            theme. To balance the layout, two acrobats are framing the poster,
            swinging from the roof.  The color scheme is based on a blue-green
            and red color palette which adds to the playfulness. It's all about
            the circus!
