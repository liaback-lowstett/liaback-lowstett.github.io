          <h3>My role</h3>
          <p> 
            As a UX designer and developer I drive the end-to-end design process and develop new features in React, Next.js, 
            Typescript and Tailwind CSS. Together with the tech team, I have developed the product by researching and 
            facilitating workshops, building user flows, wireframes and hi-fi prototypes, and conducting user tests 
            with our subscribers. 
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p> 
            At It’s Released, we have a user centric mindset focusing on creating values for our users and to create 
            intuitive and useful solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            The design process is rooted in an iterative and data-driven methodology, incorporating research, ideation, and implementation stages. By leveraging data insights and actively engaging with our users, we gain a deep understanding of the challenges they encounter, allowing us to generate innovative ideas and opportunities.
            This process unfolds through a series of steps, including workshops, user flows, and user journeys to map out the user experience. Mockups and wireframes are then crafted to visualize the design concept, followed by user testing to validate and refine these ideas. After several iterations and refinements, the design is primed for development and eventual launch, ensuring that the final product is user-centric and finely tuned.
            <br>
            <br>

          The design is done in Figma and follows the principles of atomic design, emphasizing a structured and systematic 
          approach to crafting user interfaces. In this methodology, design elements are methodically deconstructed into smaller, 
          reusable components, mirroring the way elements are categorized as atoms, molecules, and organisms in the natural world.
          This approach ensures a consistent, scalable, and efficient design process.
